# LinkedIn Jobs Scraping for Data Analysis (Data Wrangling and Visualization)

## Introduction
This project was born out of curiosity. Being new to data analysis, I was perplexed about received opinions propagated by the old ones. I thought, why not check all this out?
The steps are simple: collect, clean and analyze data.

### Collect Data
We chose LinkedIn as the jobs listing platform to scrape. To do so, we wrote a python script to go through LinkedIn and collected all the necessary data. After a poll 3 locations were chosen: Africa, Canada, and the USA.

### Clean Data
To make the data ready for analysis, we use python and its libraries.

### Analyze Data
We continue python's libraries.
